  Output: To compare the evolution of a times series between different
    periods in time, very often the tool of price indexs is used. When
    there is only one series of prices, simple price indexs are used, that
    is the percentage variation of the series, compared to a base period
    which is equal to 100. But when there are a lot of series, and the
    evolution of all these prices has to be analyzed jointly, it is
    necessary to construct a complex or weighted price index. Very often
    this tool is used to analyze the evolution over time of prices and
    quantities. In this lesson we will construct complex or weighted
    indexs with R.

- Class: figure
  Output: We will work with a simple example. We have three products,
    A, B and C, for which we have data on quantity sold and prices for
    three years, 1997, 1998 and 1999. At the window on the right you have
     a table with data for these three products. We have to enter the data
     into R to analyze them.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have to first create vectors with prices and quantities. Let's
    create these vectors for product A. Create the vector for quantities
    with 3 elements, one for each year, and give the name "q.A" to this
    vector.
  CorrectAnswer: q.A <- c(100,125,150)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='q.A <- c(100,125,150)')
  Hint: You have to enter "q.A <- c(100,125,150)" to create a vector with
    three year of quantities for product A.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create now a similar vector for the price of product A, and
    call it "p.A".
  CorrectAnswer: p.A <- c(10000,12500,13000)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='p.A <- c(10000,12500,13000)')
  Hint: Type "p.A <- c(10000,12500,13000)" to create a vector with the
    three years of data for prices of product A.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We should continue now creating vectors like these ones for
    products B and C. We have created these vectors for you. Let's put
    all these vectors q.A, p.A, q.B, p.B, q.C, p.C, in this order, in
    a data frame with the function data.frame(). Give it the name "Data".
  CorrectAnswer: Data <- data.frame(q.A, p.A, q.B, p.B, q.C, p.C)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Data <- data.frame(q.A, p.A, q.B, p.B, q.C, p.C)')
  Hint: Write "Data <- data.frame(q.A, p.A, q.B, p.B, q.C, p.C)" to create
    a data frame with the price and quantity vectors of products A, B and C.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To complete our data we will enter the names of the rows, that is
    the years. We can do this with the rownames() function, which takes
    as an argument the data frame that we just created, and we assign
    a vector with the three years to it. Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: rownames(Data) <- c(1997,1998,1999)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rownames(Data) <- c(1997,1998,1999)')
  Hint: You have to write «rownames(Data) <- c(1997,1998,1999)» to give
    a name to each row corresponding to each year.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check that we have entered the data correctly, write now "Data"
    and compare the table that you have created with the data table of
    the graph on the right window.
  CorrectAnswer: Data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Data')
  Hint: You have to enter "Data" to see how the data frame looks like.

- Class: text
  Output: When we have information on prices and quantities of different
    products, we have to always enter the data in this format in order
    to compute the price and quantity indexs, and we can do this with
    the functions priceIndex() and quantityIndex() of the miEconIndex
    package.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's compute first a complex or weighted Laspeyres index for the
    prices of the three products. The syntax of the priceIndex() function is
    priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data)*100
    where «1» stands for the year used as the base for the index. If nothing
    is specified, it is assumed that index is of the Laspeyres type. Try this
    function now, to compute a Laspeyres Price Index, and assign the result
    to "pL".
  CorrectAnswer: pL <- priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data)*100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pL <- priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data)*100')
  Hint: You have to enter "pL <- priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data)*100" to compute a Laspeyres price index and assign
    the result to "pL".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check now the price index that you have computed by entering
    the name of the object that you have created.
  CorrectAnswer: pL
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pL')
  Hint: Type "pL" to see the object you have created.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The price index allows us to see that prices grow approximately
    16% with respect to the base year the second year, and approximately
    24% the third year. A useful way of checking the evolution of prices
    is by using a time series plot of the index. We can get it with
    "plot.ts(pL)". Get now this plot.
  CorrectAnswer: plot.ts(pL)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot.ts(pL)')
  Hint: Enter "plot.ts(pL)" to see the time series plot of the Laspeyres
    price index that we have computed.

- Class: text
  Output: To obtain a much nicer plot, use the ggplot2 package that has
    more features and is more flexible than base R to create graphical
    presentations.

- Class: figure
  Output: For instance, the plot that you have on your right window for
    the Laspeyres price index was created with the command
    qplot(x=rownames(Data),y=pL,xlab="Year",ylab="Laspeyres Price Index", main="Price Index Plot") + geom_line(aes(group=1)).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain a Paasche index, we have just to add "Paasche" as the
    last argument of the priceIndex() function, that is
    priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data,"Paasche")*100. Try this command now.
  CorrectAnswer: priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data,"Paasche")*100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data,"Paasche")*100')
  Hint: Write "priceIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 1, Data,"Paasche")*100" to compute the Paasche price index.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A quantity price index can be also of the Laspeyres or Paasche type,
    and can be obtained with the quantityIndex() function, which has a similar
    syntax to the priceIndex() function. We compute a quantity index of the
    Fisher type, which is computed as a geometric mean of the Laspeyres and
    Paasche index, and with the second year as base, with
    quantityIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 2, Data,"Fisher")*100. Try this command now.
  CorrectAnswer: quantityIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 2, Data,"Fisher")*100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='quantityIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 2, Data,"Fisher")*100')
  Hint: Type "quantityIndex( c( "p.A", "p.B", "p.C" ),c( "q.A", "q.B", "q.C" ), 2, Data,"Fisher")*100" to compute a Fisher quantity index with the base fixed
     at the second year.

- Class: figure
  Output: In practical terms, prices indexs are computed using weights
    for each product based on their share in the total value of all products,
    and as a weighted mean of simple price indexs for each product. At the
    table in the right window, you can see this type of data, based on the
    same example that we used before. Let's assume that we want to compute
    a Laspeyres, Paasche or Fisher index with the base in the first year like
    before. At the table, we already have the computed weights and simple
    price indexs for the three products.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have to enter now the data for this procedure. We have already
    created vectors called pi.A, pi.B, pi.C, w.A, w.B, w.C for the simple
    price indexs and weights. Create a data frame with these vectors, in
    the same order as they are given above, using the data.frame() function,
    and assign the result to an object called "Data2".
  CorrectAnswer: Data2 <- data.frame(pi.A, pi.B, pi.C, w.A, w.B, w.C)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Data2 <- data.frame(pi.A, pi.B, pi.C, w.A, w.B, w.C)')
  Hint: Enter "Data2 <- data.frame(pi.A, pi.B, pi.C, w.A, w.B, w.C)" to
    enter the data to compute the weighted price index.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Assign as before the names of the year to each row with the
    rownames() function.
  CorrectAnswer: rownames(Data2) <- c(1997,1998,1999)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rownames(Data2) <- c(1997,1998,1999)')
  Hint: Type "rownames(Data2) <- c(1997,1998,1999)" to assign the year to
    the rows.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check the aspect of the data frame that you have created by
   typing its name.
  CorrectAnswer: Data2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Data2')
  Hint: Enter "Data2" to see the data frame that you have created.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To compute a Paasche index, where the weights used correspond to
    the current years, we use the command
    apply(Data2, 1, function(x)  weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6])). Try it.
  CorrectAnswer: apply(Data2, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value='apply(Data2, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))'
  Hint: Enter "apply(Data2, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))"
    to compute the Paasche price index and the simple price indexs and
    the weights.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To compute the Laspeyres price index, we have to keep the
    weights fixed in the base year. We have created a data frame with
    base year fixed weights so that you can see how it looks like, and
    how the data should be entered. Type "Data3" to see it.
  CorrectAnswer: Data3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Data3')
  Hint: Type «Data3» to see the data frame with the weights fixed to the
    the base year.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we can use again the same command that we used before to compute
    the weighted price index, with the "Data3" data frame,
    apply(Data3, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6])). Enter this
    command and compute a Laspeyres price index.
  CorrectAnswer: apply(Data3, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value='apply(Data3, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))'
  Hint: Type "apply(Data3, 1, function(x) weighted.mean(x[1:3],x[4:6]))"
    to compute the Paasche index with the simple indexs and the weights.

- Class: text
  Output: If you remember the values that we obtained for the Laspeyres
    and Paasche index with the first procedure. you can see that they are
    the same using this second procedure, which is the one used in practical
    applications, since usually we do not have information on quantities of
    goods and services, we just have information on values to compute the
    weights. Here we finish this lesson on how to compute index numbers with
    R.
