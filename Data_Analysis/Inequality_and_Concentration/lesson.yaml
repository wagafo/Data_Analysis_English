  Output: To understand the distribution of some variables it is useful to
    measure the degree of inequality of its values, or equivalently,
    how much these values are concentrated. For instance, to analyze the
    distribution of income or wealth, apart from the usual numerical and
    graphical summaries, it could be useful to understand to what extent
    the total sum of the values of the variable is concentrated in a few
    cases. In industrial economics, the concentration of industries is an
    important factor for the competition among firms. In this lesson we will
    learn some basic inequality and concentration measures. We will use
    a package called REAT, which has been already installed and enabled for
    you, that contains all these measures.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start with a simple example. We have created a data frame
    called "friends" that contains the data for the wages of six friends.
    Take a look at this data set with the head() function.
  CorrectAnswer: head(friends)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(friends)')
  Hint: You have to enter "head(friends)" to see the first cases of the
    variables included in the data frame "friends".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: From the data we already see that there is quite a lot of
    inequality between the wages of these friends. Jan earns significantly
    more than the rest. The Gini index is very useful to analyze inequality.
    The Lorenz curve also shows us the degree of inequality, and it is related
    to the Gini measure. We can obtain the Gini inequality measure and
    the Lorenz curve with the gini() and lorenz() functions of the REAT package.
    The command to obtain the Gini index is gini(friends$wage,coefnorm=TRUE).
    Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: gini(friends$wage,coefnorm=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: gini(friends$wage,coefnorm=TRUE)
  Hint: You have to enter "gini(friends$wage,coefnorm=TRUE)" to
    obtain the Gini measure.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To represent the Lorenz curve we use the lorenz() function, that
    takes as argument the vector of wages that we just used.
  CorrectAnswer: lorenz(friends$wage)
  AnswerTests: lorenz(friends$wage)
  Hint: You have to enter "lorenz(friends$wage)" to
    obtain the Lorenz curve.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: According to what you see in the Gini measure and the Lorenz curve,
    which statement do you think is more appropriate?
  AnswerChoices: there is inequality in the distribution of wages of the
    friends, but it is not too high; there is no inequality in the distribution
    of wages of the friends; there is extreme inequality in the distribution
    of wages of the friends
  CorrectAnswer: there is inequality in the distribution of wages of the
    friends, but it is not too high
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='there is inequality in the distribution of wages of the friends, but it is not too high')
  Hint: As the Gini index is 0.5076923 and the Lorenz curve is fairly
    separated from the diagonal, there is inequality, but considering the
    value of the Gini index which is not too close to 1, and the Lorenz
    curve which is not too close to the axis, there is not extreme inequality.
    At the following example we will find a higher degree of inequality.

- Class: text
  Output: In the real world, income, wealth or wage data are usually
    analyzed with a very large sample of individuals. Therefore the data
    does not come in individual form as our previous simple example, but
    as a frequency table, also called grouped data.

- Class: figure
  Output: Consider the figure on the right which shows world's wealth
    distribution in 2017. We can see already in the picture that there
    is a very large inequality in the distribution of wealth, as 70.1% of
    the population only holds 3.9% of wealth, while 0.7% holds 46.3% of wealth
    in the world.
  Figure: figure_wealth.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's measure this inequality with the Gini index and the Lorenz
    curve. For this we have to prepare a frequency table for the wealth
    distribution. We have prepared a data frame with these data.
    Wealth is in dollars, and population is in millions.
    Enter "Wealth_Data" to view it.
  CorrectAnswer: Wealth_Data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Wealth_Data')
  Hint: You have to enter "Wealth_Data" to view the frequency table for the
    World Wealth data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In order to analyze the data, we need to use the midpoints (class
    marks) of the intervals of the previous table, as average wealth for each
    interval. For the last interval, since it is "more than $1,000,000", we
    need to put a reasonable value. Let's use 6000000, that is six million.
    Create a vector with the midpoints of each interval and 6000000 for the
    last interval, and assign the value to a vector called "x".
  CorrectAnswer: x <- c(5000,55000,550000,6000000)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x <- c(5000,55000,550000,6000000)')
  Hint: Enter "x <- c(5000,55000,550000,6000000)" for the midpoints of each
    interval of wealth.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since the data is grouped, and we do not have individual data as in
    the first example, we need to also set the weights (frequency) for each
    interval. Let's use the percentages of population in each wealth bracket
    from the figure (70.1, 21.3, 7.9 and 0.7). Create now a vector with these
    sample weights and call it "w".
  CorrectAnswer: w <- c(70.1, 21.3,7.9,0.7)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='w <- c(70.1, 21.3,7.9,0.7)')
  Hint: Enter the information of the percentage of population of
    each wealth interval, "w <- c(70.1, 21.3,7.9,0.7)".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can now compute the Gini index, using
    again the gini() function of the REAT package,
    with gini(x,weighting=w). Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: gini(x,weighting=w)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='gini(x,weighting=w)')
  Hint: Compute the Gini index with "gini(x,weighting=w)".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To plot the Lorenz curve we use again the lorenz() function, and
    the arguments are the same as for the previous gini() function.
  CorrectAnswer: lorenz(x,weighting=w)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='lorenz(x,weighting=w)')
  Hint: Plot the Lorenz curve with "lorenz(x,weighting=w)".

- Class: text
  Output: As it can be seen both from the value of the Gini index and the
    form of the Lorenz curve, there is a high degree of inequality in the
    distribution of wealth worldwide.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A similar concept is concentration. Whenever there is inequality
    in the distribution of values of a variable, there is concentration.
    Concentration measures are used for the analysis of industries and
    markets, where also measures such as the Gini index are employed. We
    are going to work now with a data set on sales of four car
    manufacturing firms, which have sales of 20, 50, 20 and 10 (in millions
    of euros). Create a vector with these values and call it "sales".
  CorrectAnswer: sales <- c(20,50,20,10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sales <- c(20,50,20,10)')
  Hint: Enter "sales <- c(20,50,20,10)" to create the demanded vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A well-known concentration measure is the Herfindahl-Hirschman
    concentration measure. It is computed as the sum of the squares of the
    sale shares of each firm. The REAT package has a function called herf()
    that computes the Herfindahl index. It takes as argument a vector with
    sales or any other variable that measures market share. Try it now with
    the "sales" vector that we just created.
  CorrectAnswer: herf(sales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='herf(sales)')
  Hint: Enter "herf(sales)" to compute the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration
    index.

- Class: text
  Output: The value that we got for the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration
    measure, 0.34, is telling us that there is a fairly high concentration in
    this market. Take into account that if all firms had exactly the same size
    the index would be equal to 0.25 (each one has one fourth of the market),
    and considering that there are only 4 firms in the market, that would
    imply a fairly high degree of concentration. Here it is even a little bit
    more concentrated because there is a firm (the one with sales equal to
    50 million euros) that has a 50% share of the market
    (50/(20 + 50 + 20 + 10).

- Class: text
  Output: Here we have completed this lesson on the computation of inequality
    and concentration measures and graphs with R.
