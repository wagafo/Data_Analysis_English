  Output: This tutorial will give you tools to analyze the relation
    between a categorical and a numerical variable. This analysis does
    not introduce too many new tools, since it consists of a analyzing
    the distribution of a numerical variable (a single numerical variable,
    therefore we use the mean, the standard deviation, the median,
    the histogram, and so on, to describe its distribution) for each
    group defined by the categorical variable. If the distributions for
    each group are different, we say that there is a relation between
    the two variables.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will use a data frame that we have read for you called
    "rendcom", containing two variables. A numerical variable called
    "income" collecting information of the income of several people,
    and another variable called "county" telling us in which county
    each of this persons live. Enter now "rendcom" (without the
    quotation marks) to see how this data frame looks like.
  CorrectAnswer: rendcom
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rendcom')
  Hint: Enter "rendcom" to see how the data frame looks like.

- Class: text
  Output: In this tutorial we will use three R packages that we have
    already enabled for you, called "psych", "lattice" and "gplots".
    Recall to install them (install.packages("name_package")) and enable
    them (library("name_package")) in your R installation if you want to
    use them. We will now start the analysis of the relation between
    "income" and "county".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The first thing that we have to do is to obtain the numerical
    summaries of the "income" variable for each category of the "county"
    variable. For this, we sill use the describeBy() function of the
    psych package. The first argument of this function is the numerical
    variable, and the second one is the categorical variable. Try this
    function now.
  CorrectAnswer: describeBy(rendcom$income,rendcom$county)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='describeBy(rendcom$income,rendcom$county)')
  Hint: Enter "describeBy(rendcom$income,rendcom$county)" to obtain the main
    numerical summaries  for each group defined by the categorical variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Observing the distributions of the numerical variable for each
    group, we can say that
  AnswerChoices: They are quite different, therefore there is a relation
    between the two variables, the county of residence has an influence
    on income distribution; They are quite similar, therefore income is
    independent from county of residence
  CorrectAnswer: They are quite different, therefore there is a relation
    between the two variables, the county of residence has an influence
    on income distribution
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='They are quite different, therefore there is a relation between the two variables, the county of residence has an influence
    on income distribution')
  Hint: Look at the mean, the median, the standard deviation, the skewness
    coefficient, the kurtosis, and check if there different for the different
    counties.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A usual, a picture is worth thousand words. Using graphical tools
    is a very convenient way to check if the distributions of the numerical
    variable is different when we condition on the values of the categorical
    variable. The boxplot is a quite complete description of the distribution
    of a numerical variable. A very useful tool is therefore to draw
    boxplots of the numerical variable next to each other for each group
    to compare them. We can do this using the command
    boxplot(income~county,data=rendcom, xlab="County", ylab="Income"). The
    arguments xlab and ylab label the axis. Enter now this command to
    compare the distributions of the numerical variable for the different
    groups defined by the categorical variable.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(income~county,data=rendcom, xlab="County", ylab="Income")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(income~county,data=rendcom, xlab="County", ylab="Income")')
  Hint: Enter "boxplot(income~county,data=rendcom, xlab="County", ylab="Income")" to get boxplots next to each other.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: According to what we observe with the boxplots next to each other,
    which of the following statements is correct?
  AnswerChoices: There is more income spread in Barcelonès and Noguera
    than at the rest of counties; there are income outliers at
    Barcelonès and Noguera; the most frequent values of income are larger
    in Noguera than in the other counties
  CorrectAnswer: There is more income spread in Barcelonès and Noguera
    than at the rest of counties
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is more income spread in Barcelonès and Noguera than at the rest of counties')
  Hint: Look at the length of the boxes for the spread, the small circles
    for the outliers and the thick horizontal line for the most frequent
    income value (the median of income).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The other most used graphical summary for a numerical
    variable is the histogram. Therefore it is interesting to obtain
    also separate histograms for each group defined by the categorical
    variable. We can do this with the histogram() function from the
    lattice package. The appropriate command is
    histogram(~income|factor(county), data=rendcom, xlab="Income"). Try this
    command now.
  CorrectAnswer: histogram(~income|factor(county), data=rendcom, xlab="Income")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='histogram(~income|factor(county), data=rendcom, xlab="Income")')
  Hint: Enter "histogram(~renda|factor(county), data=rendcom, xlab="Income")"
    to obtain histograms for each group defined by the categorical variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "According to what we observe at the histograms for each group,
    the most frequent income is highest at the following county:"
  AnswerChoices: Bagès; Noguera; Barcelonès; Baix Llogregat
  CorrectAnswer: Barcelonès
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Barcelonès')
  Hint: Look which histogram has the modal class at a largest value for
    income.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, it is also interesting to compare the means of the
    numerical variable within each group defined by the categorical
    variable. If they are quite different we know that the categorical
    variable is related to the distribution of the numerical variable. But
    if they are similar we still have to check the other numerical
    summaries, since we can only say that the variables are independent is
    the whole distributions for each group are similar, not only the center.
    To compare only the means graphically we can use the plotmeans() function
    of the gplots package. The command is
    plotmeans(income~county, data=rendcom). Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: plotmeans(income~county, data=rendcom)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plotmeans(income~county, data=rendcom)')
  Hint: Enter "plotmeans(income~county, data=rendcom)" to obtain the plot
    of the means and compare them.

  Output: We have now a fairly complete view of the tools used to analyze
    the relation between a numerical and a categorical variable. A last
    thing to take into account, recall that there are two types of
    categorical variables, nominal and ordinal. The "county" variable
    in our previous example is ordinal, the categories have a name but
    they do not have a natural order.

- Class: text
  Output: For ordinal categorical variables, instead, we can order
    the categories, since they come from a numerical variable whose
    values have been grouped in categories. As examples consider
    "income level", "education level", "age group", and so on. If
    you want to analyze this type of variables, take care to call
    the categories in a way that will respect the order, once they
    are alphabetically ordered. A trick for this is to put "1.", "2.",
    "3.", and so on, in front of the name of each category. For instance
    "1. No schooling", "2. Primary school", "3. High school", and so on,
    for education level. If we do this, R will show us first "No schooling",
    then "Primary school", and so on.

- Class: figure
  Output: We have prepared for you boxplots side by side to analyze
    the relationship between education level and income. To have
    education level in the correct order, we have used the trick described
    above.
  Figure: figure_educ.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another difference of nominal and ordinal categorical variables
    is that in the case of the relation between a numerical variable
    and an ordinal categorical variable we can describe the relation as
    association between the variables, since the categorical variable comes
    from a grouped numerical variable. Considering this, which do you think
    is the correct statement below?
  AnswerChoices: There is a positive association between income and
    education level; There is a negative association between income and
    education level; Income and education level are two independent
    variables
  CorrectAnswer: There is a positive association between income and
    education level
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is a positive association between income and education level')
  Hint: Look if the distributions of the numerical variable vary among
    the different groups defined by the categorical variable, and if
    the income level increases with years of schooling (this is the
    numerical variable that once grouped has defined the education levels).

  Output: You have completed this lesson, where you have learned the tools
    to analyze the relation between a numerical and a categorical variable.
