- Class: text
  Output: This is a tutorial on the analysis of two categorical
    variables with R.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two ways to load the data of the categorical
    variables, 1) case by case and 2) directly from a contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We say that we have data case by case when we have the
    data in spreadsheet. The first row contains the name of the variables,
    each row contains data for one individual, and there are at least
    two columns with each categorical variable that we want to analyze.
    We have loaded a data frame for you coming from such a spreadsheet
    named "commuting", containing data of the county where 36 persons live,
    and the transport mean they use. Enter "commuting" (without quotation
    marks) to see the data "case by case" for these 36 persons.
  CorrectAnswer: commuting
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='commuting')
  Hint: You have to enter "commuting" to see the cases for the categorical
    variables included in the data frame "mobility".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain the contingency table for this data set, we just
    use the table() function, giving it the name of the data frame as
    first arguments. Try it now, assigning the result to an object
    called "dist".
  CorrectAnswer: dist <- table(commuting)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dist <- table(commuting)')
  Hint: You have to enter "dist <- table(commuting)" to obtain the contingency
    table for the categorical variables "county" and "transport" and
    assign it to an object called "dist".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The table() function shows the absolute frequency of the
    joint distribution between the two categorical variables. To see
    the results enter now "dist" (without quotation marks).
  CorrectAnswer: dist
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dist')
  Hint: You have to enter "dist" to see the absolute frequency of the
    joint distribution of the "county" and "transport" variables.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also show the joint distribution in graphical form with
    a bar plot. We can obtain a bar plot with the barplot() function.
    The first argument is the table object, and it can have several
    arguments. Try now for instance barplot(dist,legend=TRUE) to obtain
    the bar plot for the two variables in stacked form.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(dist, legend=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(dist, legend=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter «barplot(dist, legend=TRUE)» to obtain the stacked bar plot.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A useful function is t(). This function transposes a table, that
    is columns are converted into rows, and rows are converted into columns.
    Try to transpose the "dist" object we just created.
  CorrectAnswer: t(dist)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t(dist)')
  Hint: You have to enter «t(dist)» to transpose the contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: By default, R prepares bar diagrams with the column variable at
    the horizontal axis, and in stacked form. We can prepare a bar diagram
    with the row variable in the horizontal axis, and in grouped form,
    with the command barplot(t(dist),legend=TRUE,beside=TRUE), try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(t(dist),legend=TRUE,beside=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(t(dist),legend=TRUE,beside=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter "barplot(t(dist),legend=TRUE,beside=TRUE)" to obtain a bar
    plot in grouped form and with the row variable in the horizontal axis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain the relative frequency of the joint distribution of the
    two categorical variables, we use the prop.table() function. The
    argument is the table, we do not have to specify it completely because
    we can use the "dist" object that we created. Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: prop.table(dist)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.table(dist)')
  Hint: Enter "prop.table(dist)" to see the relative frequency of the
    joint distribution between the "county" and "transport" variables.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can obtain the marginal distribution of the row variable
    (in this case "county") using the margin.table() function. It has
    two arguments, the first one is the table (we can use "dist") and
    the second is 1 for the row variable. Get now the marginal distribution
    for the "county" variable.
  CorrectAnswer: margin.table(dist,1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='margin.table(dist,1)')
  Hint: Enter "margin.table(dist,1)" to see the absolute frequency of the
    marginal distribution of the row variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Similarly, we can obtain the marginal distribution of the
    column variable (in this case "transport"), in this case the second
    argument of the margin.table() function has to be 2. Get now the
    absolute frequency of the column variable "transport".
  CorrectAnswer: margin.table(dist,2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='margin.table(dist,2)')
  Hint: You have to enter "margin.table(dist,2)" to see the absolute
    frequency of the column variable of the contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain the relative frequency of the marginal distributions
    you have to use the prop.table() function, using as argument
    the marginal distribution that we just showed, for instance to
    obtain the relative frequency of the marginal distribution of the
    row variable "county" we can use the command
    prop.table(margin.table(dist,1)). Try this command now.
  CorrectAnswer: prop.table(margin.table(dist,1))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.table(margin.table(dist,1))')
  Hint: You have to enter "prop.table(margin.table(dist,1))" to see
    the relative frequency of the row variable of the contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, to obtain the conditional distributions, we use
    again the prop.table() function with two arguments. The first argument
    is the table, and the second one an indicator of the variable we
    want to use as condition. For instance, to condition on the row
    variable we use 1. Enter now the appropriate command to obtain the
    relative frequency of the distribution of "transport" conditioned
    on "county".
  CorrectAnswer: prop.table(dist,1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.table(dist,1)')
  Hint: Enter "prop.table(dist,1)" to obtain the relative frequency of
    the conditional distribution of the "transport" variable conditioned
    on the "county" variable.

- Class: text
  Output: When we observe that the conditional distributions look different
    we say that the categorical variables are related.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: According to what you observe in the conditional distributions
    of the "transport" variable conditioned on the "county" variable,
    which of the following statements is the correct one?
  AnswerChoices: there is a relation between the two variables; there is
    no relation between the two variables
  CorrectAnswer: there is a relation between the two variables
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='there is a relation between the two variables')
  Hint: Looks if the conditional distributions are similar or different.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another convenient way to look if the conditional distributions
    are equal or different is my means of a bar diagram. Setting everything
    on the same scale, it is easy to assess if there are differences
    between the proportions of the categories of the variable we want to
    analyze. For instance, to represent the bar plot of the row variable
    ("county") conditioned on the column variable ("transport") we can use
    the order barplot(prop.table(dist,2),legend=TRUE). Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(prop.table(dist,2),legend=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(prop.table(dist,2),legend=TRUE)')
  Hint: You have to enter "barplot(prop.table(dist,2),legend=TRUE)" to obtain
    the bar plot of the conditional distribution of the row variable
    conditioned on the column variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Observing the conditional distribution you just obtained graphically,
    which of the following statement is correct?
  AnswerChoices: At Noguera county is where the car is used the most; At
    the Barcelonès county is where the bus is used most
  CorrectAnswer: At Noguera county is where the car is used the most
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='At Noguera county is where the car is used the most')
  Hint: Look at the relative frequency within each column, Bus and Car,
   which shows you the proportions (over 1) of use in each county of the
   transport mean represented in the column, and look which county has the
   largest proportion.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using a 2 as second argument in the prop.table() function, we
    can get the conditional distributions of the row variable ("county")
    conditioned on the column variable ("transport"). Get now these
    distributions using the appropriate command.
  CorrectAnswer: prop.table(dist,2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.table(dist,2)')
  Hint: You have to enter "prop.table(dist,2)" to get the relative
    frequency of the conditional distribution of the row variable
    ("county") conditioned on the column variable ("transport").

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain the bar diagram of the conditional distribution of the
    row variable ("transport") conditioned on the row variable ("county"),
    we can enter the following command
    barplot(t(prop.table(dist,1)),legend=TRUE). Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(t(prop.table(dist,1)),legend=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(t(prop.table(dist,1)),legend=TRUE)')
  Hint: You have to enter "barplot(t(prop.table(dist,1)),legend=TRUE)"
    to obtain the bar diagram of the conditional distribution of the
    column variable conditioned on the row variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Apart from "case by case", we can enter data directly from a
    contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will work now with a new data set with two categorical
    variables, "preferred football team" at the rows, and "city of residence"
    at the columns. You can see the data if you enter "fans" (without
    quotation marks) at the command line. Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: fans
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fans')
  Hint: Enter "fans" to see the contingency table of the "preferred team"
    and "city of residence" variables.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We first have to enter the absolute frequency of the joint
    distribution. We create a vector with the c() function, and we
    have to enter the frequency along the rows, that is
    c(4,2,0,1,5,1,0,1,6). Assign the result to an object called "freq".
    Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: freq <- c(4,2,0,1,5,1,0,1,6)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='freq <- c(4,2,0,1,5,1,0,1,6)')
  Hint: Enter "freq <- c(4,2,0,1,5,1,0,1,6)" to enter the absolute
    frequency of the joint distribution.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, we create a table based on the frequency we have saved
    in the previous command, with the use of the matrix() function.
    We have to specify three columns (ncol=3) and that the data
    has been entered along the rows (byrow=TRUE). Furthermore, we have
    to tell R that the type of this object is "table". This is the final
    command, as.table(matrix(freq, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)). Create now this
    table object and assign it to an object called "mytable".
  CorrectAnswer: mytable <- as.table(matrix(freq, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mytable <- as.table(matrix(freq, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))')
  Hint: Enter "mytable <- as.table(matrix(freq, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))" to
    create a table of teams and cities at the "mytable" object.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To enter the names of the categories for each variable we use
    the colnames() and rownames() functions. For instance to enter the
    name of the categories of the column variable we enter
    colnames(mytable) <- c("Barcelona","Madrid","Sevilla"). Enter now
    the names of the categories of the column variable.
  CorrectAnswer: colnames(mytable) <- c("Barcelona","Madrid","Sevilla")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='colnames(mytable) <- c("Barcelona","Madrid","Sevilla")')
  Hint: Enter "colnames(mytable) <- c("Barcelona","Madrid","Sevilla")" to
    enter the names of the categories of the column variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Knowing the names of the categories for the row variable are
    "Barça", "Real Madrid", "Betis", enter these names using the
    rownames() function.
  CorrectAnswer: rownames(mytable) <- c("Barça","Real Madrid","Sevilla")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rownames(mytable) <- c("Barça","Real Madrid","Sevilla")')
  Hint: Enter "rownames(mytable) <- c("Barça","Real Madrid","Sevilla")"
    to enter the names of the categories for the row variable

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can now enter "mytable" (without quotation marks) to see
    the table we have just created.
  CorrectAnswer: mytable
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mytable')
  Hint: Enter "mytable" to see the contingency table.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have already created the contingency table. We can now
    analyze the relation between the two categorical variables just as
    we did with the previous example. For instance, get the bar plot
    of the conditional distribution of the "teams" variable conditioned
    on "city", using the command barplot(prop.table(mytable,2),legend=TRUE).
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(prop.table(mytable,2),legend=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(prop.table(mytable,2),legend=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter "barplot(prop.table(mytable,2),legend=TRUE)» to see the
    conditional distribution of "team" conditioned on "city".

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Checking the conditional distributions of "team" conditioned
    on "city" we can say that
  AnswerChoices: There is a relation, team preference is affected
    by city of residence; There is no relation, team preference is
    independent of city of residence
  CorrectAnswer: There is a relation, team preference is affected
    by city of residence
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is a relation, team preference is affected by city of residence')
  Hint: Check the relative frequency of each column for each city, to see
    if the proportions of preference for teams are different within the
    different cities.

- Class: text
  Output: You have finished this lesson on the analysis of two categorical
    variables. You now know how to enter the data and how to determine if
    there is a relation or if we can say that the categorical variables are
    independent.
